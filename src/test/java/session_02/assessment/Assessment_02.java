    Write a simple calculator program that:

        Asks the user to input two numbers.
        Asks the user to select an operation (+, -, *, /).
        Based on the selected operation, perform the calculation and print the result.
        Use a switch statement to handle the operation selection, and include a try-catch block to handle division by zero errors.

    Requirements:

        Use a switch statement to decide which operation to perform.
        The program should handle invalid operators by displaying an error message.
        Catch and handle any arithmetic exceptions (like division by zero).
