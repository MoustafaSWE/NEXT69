    Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter their age, and based on the input, classify the user into one of the following categories:

        Child: 0 to 12 years
        Teenager: 13 to 19 years
        Adult: 20 to 64 years
        Senior: 65 years and older
        Use an if-else structure to classify the user's age, and handle the case where the input is negative (invalid age).

    Requirements:

        The program should print an error message if the age entered is negative.
        Use exception handling to manage non-integer inputs.
